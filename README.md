# musikandi
A free editable music industry contacts database with options for users to build their own contacts databases, share or keep private.

The idea came as a way of storing and sharing an increasingly out of date list of contacts, numbering in the 1000s, from when I worked in the music industry. Some personnel would move on and these contacts would become out of date quickly. Others - venues and businesses - their details would normally stay the same.

As it is, Musikandi works OK. It needs better styling and probably needs to be more focussed on its true purpose as a database. Sections on news and featured artists can go. Background info on companies can probably go too.

<b>I am interested in any ideas for technical improvement.</b>
