<div class="news-column-headline">Agency: French Music Bureau</div>
French government agency with offices in London and across Europe. Useful contacts for sourcing and promoting French bands or any French related festivals/ music.</br></br>Quite wide parameters when defining bands of French origin, so always worth checking if there's any funding or promotional tie-ins available if artists have ever been French based, or have members who are French.

<div class="news-column-headline">Festival/Conference: byLarm</div>
Norwegian industry showcase. Seminars and talks during the day. Showcases at night. Mainly Norwegian bands with a few Swedish and Finnish. There's always some interesting bands that are looking for exposure in the UK. Norwegian promoters are pretty good to deal with, but the exchange rate means that they'll
never make much money from touring the UK, so always go in with a good media package. Well worth contacting <a href="http://www.norway.org.uk/norwayandcountry/culture/music/" title="contact Norwegian embassy" target="_blank" class="newsLink">Norwegian embassy</a> in London who can be really helpful in sourcing and promotion of Norwegian artists in the UK.

<div class="news-column-headline">Festival: Paredes Decoura 2014</div>
20-23 Aug. 2014. Well-established festival in northern Portugal. This years line-up includes Franz Ferdinand and Black Lips.</br></br>
Fly out to Porto, then beg a lift to the site which is in the far north, near the Spanish border. Or you could start in Vigo (Spain) then drive over the border.</br></br>Definately one for people who enjoy festivals that are off the beaten track, but the organisers always put on good shows and there's no real curfew. Camping on-site.</br><a href="http://www.paredesdecoura.com/" title="Paredes Decoura 2014" target="_blank" class="more quote">www.paredesdecoura.com</a>
