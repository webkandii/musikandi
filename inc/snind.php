Art and music agency. Offices Paris, Berlin and London. Interesting roster with a focus on European bands, with a few UK, American and the rest of the world. Gallon Drunk right through to the Warlocks, with weird pop and techno mixed in. Their email update gives a comprehensive list of tours and band availabilities. Good way to source small to medium sized venues.
