<p>The Wire is a UK avant garde music magazine, concentrating on contemporary jazz, experimental, hip hop, modern classical, free improvisation, post-rock, and electronic music. One of the best music magazines anywhere in the world. Its circulation is tiny BUT if you're promoting niche music and you secure pre-event coverage, or buy a decent advert, you will be targeting exactly the right audience. Best if your show is in London as this is where most of the readership is based.</p>

<div class="news-column-headline">Photographer: Simon Fernandez</div>
Simon used to almost be our in-house photographer back in the day. He's prolific and specialises in capturing the energy of live performance, while also conveying the poignancy of soloists and lead performers.</br>
I'll never understand how live music photographers can take such high quality shots in often crowded, beer soaked spaces as this shot of Fucked Up at the Old Blue Last shows. As Simon say, "that was the first time I saw Fucked Up, and I was properly surprised when he started hitting himself in the head with the microphone." Check out his archive.

<div class="news-column-headline">Photographer: Carlo Verfaille</div>
Belgian photographer Carlo Verfaille took a memorable series of shots of cult U.S. performer David Eugene Edwards (Woven Hand, 16 Horsepower), famous for his fire and brimstone inspired performances.</br>
I don't know too much about Carlo other than he also works for culture and media website <a href="http://www.cuttingedge.be" target="_blank" class="more quote">cuttingedge.be</a>, and that he was kind enough to send me the entire series of photos he took of Woven Hand when they performed in Belgium. At the time I was working for their German record label.

<div class="news-column-headline">Photographer: Chris Mills</div>
Chris documented what was one of the most important gigs of 2007 for a few dedicated fans and musicians when he recorded the last night of a small venue in east London. The Spitz existed for barely 10 years, and became one of the best spaces to see high quality established and soon to be famous bands. This photo is a cropped version of saxophonist Bryan Edwards who is part of London's thriving contemporary jazz circuit. Full version and many others well worth checking out on Chris's website.</br><a href="http://chrismills.turnpiece.net/gallery/896" title="Chris Mills" target="_blank" class="more quote">chrismills.turnpiece.net/gallery/896</a>
